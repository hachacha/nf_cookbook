i am a little high. drank a vietnamese instant coffee in order to keep me focused on cleaning the basement. my ex broke into my house while i was away and then thought i was going to kill myself because my house was so messy.
i've been gone for like half of the last two months.
i feel that i'm missing my voice - in a mist, randomly having the feeling that i missed a stair. overall okay i guess. trying.

thinking back to the food popup in the mostly dead mills mall. it would be nice to have simple, "healthy"/not processed, cheap. no idea if people would go for this from tarentum.
can you byob to the mall? mills mall is owned by some real sheisters it seems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdar_Realty_Group

## ingredients

mango
green olives 

## method

cut to about the same size. i did 1/4"cubes. this was an interesting flavor combination. i added oil but probably didn't need to. it needs a third thing - some herb. dill wasn't it. maybe taragon or cilantro or mint.
