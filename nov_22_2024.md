rolling with the punches limitations of this kitchen and my bitch-ass neighbor upstairs who said "are you cooking curry or something? the smell is very strong" 
had to bust out the hot plate + cast iron and finish outside in a mild november rain
but this meal ended up being fucking delicious despite the challenge. 

it's not a novel thought but it's wild how much the food you make is a reflection of the tools or environment you have. 
similar to the concept of the language you use shapes how you think and see the world. 

> Using magnetic resonance tomography, scientists observed the brains of native German and Arabic speakers and discovered differences in the wiring of the language regions in the brain. The high-resolution images not only show the brainâ€™s anatomy but also allow us to derive the connectivity between the brain areas using a technique called diffusion-weighted imaging. The data showed that the axonal white matter connections of the language network adapt to the processing demands and difficulties of the mother tongue.

^ well it shapes the brain

> The hypothesis is in dispute, with many different variations throughout its history.[2] The strong hypothesis of linguistic relativity, now referred to as linguistic determinism, is that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and restrict cognitive categories. This was a claim by some earlier linguists pre-World War II;[3] since then it has fallen out of acceptance by contemporary linguists.


well whatever. 
- not having a dishwasher has made me reuse the same pan so i think about the seasoning of the last dish and how that will be transferred into the next. again with the infinite....
- i use the broiler all the damn time to just grill/heat up something quickly
- maximizing certain ingredients, serving things out of pumpkins, using the end of the horseradish to plant a new horseradish

going to tbilisi georgia last month all the food was very specific to their environment. i've never had some of those flavors before. could not recognize a lot of the spices. there were familiar animals being used in the food but the way they were butchered was different than what i'm used to so my mouth was unfamiliar with these new bone alignments to navigate. (reminder to make this recipe https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/tbilisi/2023/recipe-chakapuli-the-verdant-and-tart-pearl-of-georgian-stews/ )
it's important to be able to adapt. to change your cooking style shouldn't be the same difficulty as redoing all of computing to a ternary rather than binary system. we are not computers and should not

## method

rice:

mustard and caraway. butter. celery and carrot. add rice toast that up. add mushrooms. add stock or water until done. also salt.

cabbage:
steam it with water and the ACV and anise.

lamb:

i didn't have enough breadcrumbs. i was following this recipe that said a cup of milk an a cup of breadcrumbs but i ate most of the bread so i had to improvise. 
toast rice until a little after it starts cracking and talking back and then it will turn a little goldy. throw the teff in at this point and wait until that starts popping as well. pour al of that into a grinder or mortar+pestle and turn it into powder. if it's toasted enough it should be easy to break the rice down. otherwise you're probably going to take your sweater off with the effort you put into grinding those grains like i did. you will need enough of this and breadcrumbs to make a sturdy ball so keep that in mind i just eyeballed it.
soak the breadcrumbs, teff and rice powder in the milk.
cut the sage oregano and onion and garlic finely. recipe i was "following" said to grate the onions but i like a bit of texture. they also said to use 2 beef stock tablets as seasoning but fuck that. season how you think it should be.
put the lamb, onion, garlic, and seasoning into the bowl with the milk and grains and mix with your hands. form them into patties and then make a hole in the middle because that's just fun. i wonder if this could be like done wrapped around a kebab and then put over a grill? probably.
i got a text at this point from my upstairs neighbor saying it smells too much. from what, the carraway and onions and toasted rice? i think someone was just feeling a little lonely.
so i went outside and cooked it in the cast iron grease spitting all over the place. 
cook one side of these patties and then when you flip them add in lemon juice or slices of lemon.  i added some broth as well and covere at this point because it was cold outside and figured it would be a bit faster. i also threw in whole peppers in there. but those would be good if you could fry them and make them crispy like a sri lankan style side to bite into

sauce:

i burned some of the lamb to the bottom of that pan so instead of scrubbing it off later i made a sauce and deglazed to get that tuff stuff off. i did this inside. it's not going to disturb the man upstairs.
chop the celery 
add like 3tblsp butter or more to the pan
put in the celery. then the wine then the mint. i liked how this was when it came out early on but it got muddied the longer i cooked it down. it was much brighter. this could also maybe be mixed in with yogurt.

## review

was eating leftovers today and the embarrassingly bold thought "fuck i'm so fucking good at cooking"
