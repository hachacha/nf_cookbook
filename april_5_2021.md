end of lenten season easter was yesterday
made a fucking great duck - canard au vin . i should flambe more. be flam bae.
but that was yesteray
today had some leftover beans becuase i soaked too many for a beans n greens n pork i had last week
not enough beans to do like a full-on mexidish. don't really like hiding beans in salads
pretzels have been mogging me so bean dip is whats we got.
it's light and i guess it's healthy. the celery makes you think that. perfect chaser to 2 bottles of champagne and a barefoot brand rich redwine drunkduck.


## ingredients

about a qt of beans - i used navy/pinto
nice olive oil
2 celery ribs
juice of half a lemon
cumin, oregano, sage, salt i forgot to put in pepper but it wouldn't hurt. i dont think it needs it
2 cloves garlic




## method

PUT IT ALL IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR AND TURN IT ON AND LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR 5 HOURS



jk just put it in and blend until it looks like you can pick it up on a pretzel.
