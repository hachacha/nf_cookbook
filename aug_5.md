israel bombed some shit in syria
then a big explosion happened in beirut from some explosives that were in there just a few days later. lebanon is currently governed by hezbollah and in debt a shit-ton to the imf. china trying to get in there to have a direct port open to syria to help with reconstruction / putting them in debt so they can own syria in a few years
shit's great. haven't been up on global news since all the front page stuff is ellen degenerous getting cancelled and trump spinning numbers and msm spinning numbers back at him. 
actually did this a few days ago but never got around to put in the entry

## ingredients

rice
lambshanks
fava/broad/fart beans
tomato
onion
butter
garlic
stock

### spices

cumin
s&p
tumeric

### herbs
	
parsley
dill
cilantro (i didn't have but used coriander)
chives (can use onion)
sage
thyme


## method

soak rice in water for like an hour or as long as the next part takes
i soaked my bigbeans too becuase they were dried

basic braise the lamb shanks - get it covered with salt and pepper, nice to let sit for a second. brown on all side in butter or oil (i used ghee), set aside
add onion, then  garlic, tomato and spices. cook down. add sage and thyme, place shanks on top and cover them about 3/4 way up with broth
put in oven at 350 or lower for a few hours or until meat is tender

when you're done with that
peel the beans if they're dried - the skin is tough
big pot(i actually used a small pot and then moved over to a big cast iron i think i'd recommend that), boil water for rice n beans
strain the rice and rinse off a little to remove starch
add the rice and cook for just a few minutes . the thing i was following said "until the rice elongates" but idk i used brown rice they were doing basmati i think if you wait just a bit. i rinsed a bit to remove more starch
put oil in to same pot or move to cast iron dutch
add the rice back in with the remaining herbs (parsely, dill cilantro, chives) and beans
take the lamb out of the ove and pour in a bit of the stock you have from there in to the rice
cover
they said to wrap around the lid with a towel, whcih i did but i don't know how much that acheived but my towel smelled good afterwards.
you can mix a bit in the begining but you really want to have the rice cook and harden on the bottom not burn! but harden. it's nice but it feels really tricky to get a sense of when to change.

got bored and made some collared greens with olives, mint, garlic and hot green peps.
