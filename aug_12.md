it's a carrot wine. the last one i did i was not pleased with the color or how light it is on carrot flavor -- granted i have not let it sit for very long but w/e its clear and we have more so i made more
juiced a bunch of carrots for juice. still working on that 25lb bag of shit that we got forever ago. leftover with all this pulp after doing about 10lbs and still more carrots leftover. like damn. 
carrots keep forever. the fridge is purgatory may be a concept from that seth rogen movie about sausages. but i didn't see it.


## started on aug 6

## put into secondary on 12 (6 days. could have been done @ 5)

## ingredients

10lbs of carrots pulp (byproduct of juicing) 
like 8 more carrots unjuiced and sliced thin
750g of sugar (probably needed more)
juice of 2 grapefruits and 1 lemon
1.25 cups of raisins
.75 cup of honey shit's expensive
2.5gal of water or so -- better to do 3 i think.
1 bag of chai tea
champagne yeast

## method

boil all the kinds of carrots for like 1.5hours
in a big 5gl bucket (non bpa) put in sugar, honey and throw in raisins
dump in all that hot carrot shit and stir around until dissolved
keep covered and wait overnight for it to cool
i had actually forgotten to put in the citrus stuff so i did that now, with the yeast and the chai tea. i had to activate this yeast in a bowl of water before adding it, so i did!
stir this about 3 times daily until fermentation stops
this makes sure that mold does not form on the top and you keep the solids down in the liquids
when you stir you will see a bunch of white bubbles that show that the yeast is active
you should also see that the solids, especially the pulp, will be at the top and thick which implies that the yeast is burping and pushing the solids up.
it was actually pretty interesting, the pulp was definitely eaten up a bit by the 4th day and it was easier to stir, the pulp was not so much at the top and broken down quite a bit.
there were less bubbles on the fifth day but i didn't have an airlock so i had to go get one today.
strain all that shit through some cloth, it's time-consuming and pruning, into a carboy and lock it with an airlock. now the yeast is in the airlock purgatory. keep it there until it's no longer bubbling and the airlock shows a 50/50 split between the two chambers - this is with the S style locks.
idk how long it will take this is a first attempt
but it's much more carrot-colored
