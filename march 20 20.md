the world has been engulfed by coronavirus
it's come to pa
i got one person here in cmu who fell ill but didn't know til recently
been workin from home for a while
sadie also has been working from here
it's nice
we get to trade skin a lot
i feel like the more we do the more we smell the same
so obviously we gotta be sharin some virus

for this thing i saw a recipe for indian food tht called for soaking cashews and raisins before blending them so that you can use them in the gravy

### so

cashews & (green) raisins in equal parts in some water - soak for 30 mins
beef
ginger (a whole damn knob the size of a thumb maybe)
garlic (i used like 6)
onion
peppers
GHEE AND SOME MUSTARD OIL
(maybe stock)



### spices

mustard-
tumeric
cinnamon
clove
cardamom
chili chili chili

### cookin

__

put the cashews and raisins in water and soak
might as well throw in ginger and garlic 

__

i got this beef in cubes
threw in ginger, buncha salt and pepper
let it sit

__

hit the blend button and blend the fuckin gingergarliccashewraisins

__

heat up ghee
add a touch of mustard oil (for fun. i like the smell)
cook the onions and green hot peppers to fuck 7 mins so they soft. i cut 'em real skinny
throw in the mustard seeds
dump the gingergarlic + raisincashew  thing in
throw in the spices
keep cookin
when it starts getting thick or sticking you put in water or stock
keep doing that 
add the beef
put on low and cover
keep scraping the bottom every so often
do that for like 1.5 hours until beef b tender


this is a lot of instructions but it's not really that much work.

eat it iwth some rice.
