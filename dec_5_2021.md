damn it overlowed the carlo rossi bottle and kept doing it too.
moved it to the bucket
put it in the basement
added a little more water during the process. hopefully i don't fuck it up.

so in the basement the airlock is like half and half...
i bring it upstairs and it starts burbling away
i wonder if it's because of the air pressure down there versus up here? the temperature that i have inside the bucket compared to outside? when i originally sealed it?
is the seal that good?
what's up with that.
like up here it's only 63 but down there its probably like 50 something or less... i dunno.

i'm taking a scoop out to put in to a hopper recipe as "toddy". which is supposed to be a palm flower liquor.
