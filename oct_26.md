my parents just left

watermelon radish make it sweet
day after it makes the room you're eating it in smell like a fart.

## ingredients
2 watermelon radish
pecans
balsamic
dates or some other dried fruita
some water

## method
chop some dates and add with the some water into a saucepan
some water enough to go halfway up the dates
turn it on medium and wait until it's steamy to add balsamic
reduce reduce the dates will get plomp and start to deconstruct themselves
while that's happening slice the radish thin
toast the pecans and chop them fine
the sweetness of the dates should have leeched in to the reduced vinegar. allow for the sauce to cool a little before adding it on top. i added some salt and mixed well
i didn't add all the dates because i was concerned about having that texture in there.
it's good.
