just 2 days on the otherside of the solstice now.
i got turnip greens shortly after pulling all my own turnips up and thinking "how the fuck does anyone eat these fuzzy green shits?" would rather dry 'em out and make a damn faux-felt yurt. during some pace around a shopping plaza i went in to a kuhn's. 

my anise from last year is still going strong and big on fronds. they're about dick-height and wave at me all the damn time. same with the cannabis plant. those two make a strong appearance in this dish.

i'm still digesting and hoping i don't get stoned but i don't think i will.

this is like a indian beans and greens.

## ingredients

1.5 bunch turnip greens
two thumb-sized knobs of ginger - or just like two thumbs next to each other of ginger like down to your second knuckle. i guess maybe your third if you're small. shit
6 cloves of garlic
1 jalapeno
1 large red onion
can o cannelini beans 
some stock


## spice (in order of use and amount)

whole cumin
black mustard
curry leaves (can skip)
3 dried red peppers

coriander
black pepper
turmeric
cardomom

a big bunch of fresh fennel fronds
top bit of weed - just the leaves - this is probably about equal weight to the fronds.  you put both the anise and marihuanaica together in your hand and it's a great smell



## method

use coconut oil or butter. i used both. in a dutch oven sort of thing. it can be shallow. just so long as there's a cover.
i think i'm stoned actually now that i'm writing this and looking it over. not in a bad way though.
add the cumin, mustard, curry leaves and peppers and keep on high until you hear them start to pop.
throw in the garlic, pepper, onion and ginger all at once. they should be chopped fairly fine. swish them around, i put the heat to low for a bit and covered while i prepped the turnip greens. all you do for those is chop off excess stem and make them a bit smaller. roughly
put the heat on high,add the second set of spices with coriander and mix and heat it up a bit before adding the greens
add the stock. it should be shallow, not covering the greens yet because they haven't wilted. mix it more until when you see it boilin/bubbling turn it down to low and cover.
wait a few minutes stir occaisionally and add fronds and oui'd which you chopped fairly fine when you see that the things have wilted a bit
after this whenever you are satisfied, add the beans 
that is all.
