happy new year n'en-sum. i brought it in by making a cassoulet a la julia child. short ribs instead of lamb. 

my sister just had surgery. i had forgotten it was so soon. i thought it was on the eleventh.
i had a long day in the office, stopped at trader joe's (women fuckin love shopping @ trader joe's), got home and received an emotional phonecall from my dad and discovered my mother is going out to see kk on a 3pm fight the next day, called mom, called jim and katrina, talked to my mom again. groceries still in bags on the floor
jeffery bursts in with 1.4 colt45s and a newport long. demands i go see his racing car set in his garage. i get there and Brick's "ain't gonna hurt nobody" is blaring to the point i can't hear him. i decide to leave after i finish a cigarette and like 10 dap-ups and he is sitting on the table in his hi-viz onesie clattering with racing car tracks and fumbling an extension cord yelling "i'm not her son motherfucker i live here!".
had a couple quick shots of whiskey and got to work.



## ingredients

sunchokes, celery, carrot, red onion, garlic, egg, cornmeal, nutritional yeast(can skip this), bacon
	- majoram, rosemary, black pepper
yourt, fish sauce, lemon, black pepper
spinach, hot pepper, red onion
	- nutmet, black pepper... something else i forget maybe caraway or jeera.


## method

grate teh sunchokes, celery and carrot. sunchokes shoul be the star ingredient. i had about a pound and a half, a BIG thick gmo carrot i used like 3/4 of. it was like the size of a foot. one stalk of celery. garlic and onion chopped fine. mixed that with the egg cornmeal and nutritional yeast in a bowl. you'll know the ratio when you get it right because you'll be able to make them into patties. i think you can use 2 eggs if it's not binding. but nutritional yeast can work as a binder too. i ended up reassessing and adding more cornmeal twice. 
once that's ok, squeez out the water if you can and reserve it.

cook bacon in a skillet in some butter, retain the fat and remove once it's done to your liking.
cook the patties in that bacon fat and compress them. i put a small cast iron on top. i think the celery made the water appear.

chop the hot pepper and red onion fine. in a separate pan you can cook that. add the spinach on top and mix it around. cover it if you want. use the reserved liquid you squeezed out of the patties and pour some of it in the pan with the spinach. if the spinach wilts a bunch you can add more if you want. add the spices and just keep an eye on it. if its covered and liquidy you'll probably be fine.

separately combine yogurt fish sauce lemon and black pepper. this sauce is 100% nice and good on the patties. 

i wish i had more bacon or meats with this.
i had the leftovers with sardines and lentils the next day 

my sister is okay and i'm happy my mom is there.
