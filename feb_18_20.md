today i'm in the office and i reheated some soup
i had bought a sandwich too from the zebra lounge and chomped it chin perched above the plastic container to feel like i'm dribbling crumbs there and not all over everywhere else. this office is gross. it's like a dorm.
i reheated the soup later
alone in the lounge everyone's gone 
the celery i chopped floated on top of the chicken fat 
the purple potatoes colored the less oily part but would break through when i stirred.
the tiny celery leaves were like gold flakes in the fat being pierced by purple sloshes
it was relaly nice
little allspice peepin ploatin aroun


it tatsted better today than yesterday

lessee

chicken broth 1.5 qts
some water
mung beans potatoes
^these all go in at once
spices afterwards -- 2 cardomom pods, like 7 allspice, some fenugreek and some fennel
leave covered and have it simmer

separately
sautee onion and celery finely chopped
leave some celery aside that's a bit rougher
sautee in carrot chunks
spiced with salt and pepper, chili pepper (something smokey like guajarlaiwojai or you know... not just the bright red shit get the dark red or brown stuff. but whatever you have is probably fine.)
when the carrots are basically soft but not totally soft and the potatoes are kind of soft combine the onion and celery and carrots in to the other pot
you can turn off one or the other depending on which one is done first before you dump together.
cook it and stir it a bit leave covered.
