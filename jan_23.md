RICE
- cut carrots and garlic to about the same size. not minced but pretty small. 
- throw them in water with salt while it boils 
- once boiling, add rice
- turn the heat down and monitor that stuff to make sure it doesn't burn adding more water accordingly

POTATO
- preheat oven to 420 bro
- halve the potatos and cut out a little notch in the orange center
- cut some garlic into halves or like thumbnail size retaining their thickness ...like one inch pieces
- toss all that shit together with cumin, paprika, s&p in oil or melted butter
- stuff a garlic in the little notch :) `you can add more notches or make deeper notches depending on how you like it`
- but doing this prevents the garlic from burning straight on the baking sheet
- i forgot how long i left it in there but just poke a fork on 'em every now and then and when it goes in soft you good
	> in the past if i did this and did not heavily spice the potatos i would be making an herb butter 
	```(literally just melt butter, take it off the heat and throw in some kind of herb (rosemary, taragon, chives, garlic or thyme (or combination of those) do well) )```
	> in the meantime, take the potato out of the oven when it begins to get a little soft, dump that herby butter on top and then broil it for a second. this kind of chars the garlic and browns the butter on top of the already sweet sweet potato. it's nice!

BRUSSEL GARNISH
- cut bottoms of brussel sprouts, you don't need many, i used like 3
- after halfing, cut pretty thin.
- cut some onion just as thing, you want a little less onion than you do brussel sprouts
- throw into butter or oil on high
- you kind of want these charred/overcooked as it's a texture you're looking for. mix often.
- as quickly as you can get the chili, sumac, s&p on top and jiggle that all around
- chop the nuts you got and put the brussel garnish over the rice and the nuts you got over that.

kimchi is a good side
some thin cut and then fried spam would go well with this if you require a protein
as always, egg would also be fine on the side. 
	originally i had intended to do something like an omelette with the brussels but this made more sense somehow.
