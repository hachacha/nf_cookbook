i made a salad that's like mild in a nice way
like youc ould eat it infinitely
if you were just looking for an infinite jaw workout

## ingredients
red lettuce
garlic
cashews
the nanny
s&p
white wine vinegar 
water melon radish (although i think that watermelon OR any pepp'ry radish would be great here)
pecorino romano
nice olive oil
capers

## method
toast the cashews and garlic together. leave the garlic in kind of large pieces to avoid burning. dump in olive oil if necessary (i walked away so i did when i came back and saw how fucked i was.)
it's a salad add all that shit together and EAT IT
