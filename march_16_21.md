i invited a someone i met on the internet over to have steamed cheeseburgers after trading numbers and having to answer for connecticut. the least i could do to defend my state was to try to make a steamed cheese.
i felt uneloquent when answering questions and i found my self to deflecting or being short (little sour at myself about that) but i could ask her dumb questions all day i just really liked hearing her talk.
maybe wasn't the best idea to cook something you've never tried that's more of a technical challenge than whatever the other part of cooking is. straightforward foodstuff? trinities? smells?
dunno. anyways. sweated beef is charming.

happened upon banana leaf in giant eagle so steamed in those. outside. for covid.


## ingredients

banana leaves
sharp cheddar
grounbeef
bun
burger toppings

## method

make patties with some s&p don't overseason.
wrap patties in the banana leaves and steam for 10 minutes or so.
wrap cheese in banana leaves and steam for less than that!
the wraps were a little awkward | she did her s better | seemed to work best if you wrapped it within itself rather than trying to patch with other leaves.
dump everything out| make a show of it with lots of self-deprecating jokes and gentle ribbing about the entire process | on a bun | talk so much that everything gets cold | and enjoy
