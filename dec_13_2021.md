im on a ferment kick. life life life.
can't play in the garden. no sun in the sky. grow some shit and have it talk back to me.
beet stalk n green sauerkraut

i think i may have fucked this up by putting in some old dried onion in there... we'll see in two weeks i guess

it was 8oz of beet stalk and leaves
i put in about 7-8grams of salt
moooved it around
smooshed it around
ended up like pinching individual bits to make them burst
it was about like an hour of waiting and i went back to it
added in like a clove of garlic
probably a tablespoon of dried chili flakes from the garden
a pinch of dried onion
and a pinch of dried shrimp
the last two ingredients i think are unecessary. perhaps will b detrimental
i think maybe a couple black peppercorns would be nice
