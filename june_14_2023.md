# cactus 

i found cactus in giant eagle market district
imagine that
just kidding. you already are imagining it because you fucking read that i found it in giant eagle market district, idiot.
although who knows what you imagine when i say "giant eagle market district". like that's some kind of military code for a bombing formation or something. or like a consumer pagan prayer. especially if you're not from around pittsburgh.
but really i'm just kidding again. "who knows what you image"? you know what you imagine because you fucking read it jesus facking christ you're so gullible.
watching this trailer for a christian bale x mathew mconahay movie for killing dragons with gatling guns... damn. i guess i'll watch that. 

anyways

i made two things with it so far that i liiiike

~ why tf are these brittish people in a mine drinking budweiser? ~

## nopales salad

1 avacado
2 cactus leaves
carrot julienned
juice of one lemon
salt
pinch of pepper
1 or 2 clove of garlic
some raw red onion

damn i think that's it.
pretty basic
i had it in addition to some microwaveable paneer curry thing
and some celery rice



## cactus sardine speciale

reworked the celery rice into a basic bitch stir fry 
on the side had some sardines in there. needed protein m8

miso
corriander
clove
black pepper
fennel
oil from the can of sardines; reserve the sardines. (you better be buying your sardines with olive oil in it. they're basically the same price as the ones in water. and then you're paying for water to be in there instead of oil...)
^grind the spices, put it in a bowl with the oil, slop it up together to a paste. 
add cactus, toss that
now add the sardines. lightly toss that. if you had added them before they'd be all fucked up and in pieces. so i guess you could do that if you want. i like the whole 'dines.
put it all in a skillet and broil until whenever the fuck you want to stop. 
don't burn the cactus, mix it every now and then if you feel.
at the end i threw in some fenugreek sprouts i had going outside. love me methi sprouts.
but i think parsley or some other fresh wilty herb would be good.
mix it in and the heat of teh skillet and all the vegs should wilt them nicely.
now eat it with the stir fry.
