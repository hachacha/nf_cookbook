happy new year
been on and off a bit of a bender recently. thoughts manifest reality and vice versa. what to say about wanting to remain fucked up. i mean i guess the usa and my current reality is pretty fucked up too right now. capitol building stormed. nearly 500 million dead from 'rona. that's more than the population of metropolitan pittsburgh. 's'like we got nuked. 1/13 people have had it. 
right now my fingertips are stained metal-ish black. i don't know if it's from working with that shit-knife on carving or because i got motor oil on my hands. 
i needed some greens. last night i just had soup and flaming hot cheetos and half a fifth of hundy proof.
the smoked herring in this gets fruity. the whole thing at the end is fruity, smokey and milky. it's very nice.

## ingredients

collared greens, i would not recommend thin strips.
smoked herring, rough chop
garlic, rough chop
coconut milk
cashews
vinegar or lime
dry peppers (not necessary)

### spoices
1 whole cumin
2 all-spice
2 black pepper
1 oregano/marjoram or something herby->flowery not oily and dense like rosemary
just one long pepper or maybe rue if you can't find those. it's not necessary 
salt

## method

oil in pan, i used coconut, whole cumin and dried peppers, i used some sort of spicy indian thing, cook until you can smell the cumin maybe it changes color a little
garlic and smoked herring both in there cook about 3 minutes
put in collared greens mix it around until the whole things shiny, add some salt (herring might be salty) stir more
add coconut milk and maybe some water or broth if you need to stretch it out. 
add rest of spices
cover and cook and stir some times and add some vinegar or acid when things look even darker. you want to braise the stuff so it's a lil brown-ish.
