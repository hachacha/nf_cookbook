yesterday i ran a half marathon and won the road apple challenge award
er just the award
with megan
we ate a lot of amish food right after 
and then we ate some of a ridiculous pizza after driving through gettysburg
i was very sore and today i had 2 slices for lunch
i'm all full of grease and needed something fresh
celery soup full loud with herbs


## ingredients

bunch of celery
red onion
stock

garlic 
corn
oregano

dill
purple basil

s&p



## method

soften the celery and red onion in one big pot or pan
separately get the corn and garlic (in large-ish pieces) going in some butter in a cast iron on like low to medium. throw oregano in there too. stir semi-frequently. you want it like kind of roasted kind of

once the celery and red onion are making good noise and are soft add the stock and bring up to a boil
throw it all in a food processor. i wish my concotion was more green like the celery but my stock has a bunch of red onion skins in it so it's always dark :\

add it back to the pot, add the corn and garlic, add dill chopped up. garnish with basil.

happy nine eleven
