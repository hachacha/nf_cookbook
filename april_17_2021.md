## method

### sardines
broil the sardines.
sardines.

### cwikla
boil the beet for a long time - like an hour
put everything in the food processor. it's best to eyeball the horseradish and not put that much in. you can always put in more later if it's not to your taste. pulse a few times, blend it til mostly smooth you may have to add more water.

### miso soup
when you are cleaning the rest of your house because you have a girl you're sweet on coming over and you don't want her to know exactly how much hair you shed yet you can put some shiitake mushrooms in some water on low and get some shit done.
after a while - like 40 minutes - you can strain it retaining the water. chop the mushrooms a bit
put butter or oil in a pot, throw in garlic and celery or just celery on high, add miso after a few minutes and carmelize that in there with the mushrooms for another few minutes.
add the mushroom broth you unwittingly made and now you have a soup.

### stir fry
just do the stir fry thing. high heat good amount of peanut oil.
fragrant shit first, then the main vegetables after - chopped the brussel sprouts fine. the burdock root long. i left the skin on.
rice, and then the cookin liquids. that's it.

#### assemblage
eat soup first
place sardines on top of stir fry
dollop of the beets next to it.
