these spices just worked well together and i wanted to get it down


## it's just a damn salad and some tinfish

had some sardines that were broiled in oil with ajawan seeds, whole garlic cloves, oregano (i think (i don't remember))

salad of: arugala, pear, red onion,
dressing of: peach vinegar (this is from the wine that i made that i fucked up), nice oil, summac, clove, black pepper
the clove and the pear and the summac is key, boi.

but the ajawan, summac and clove is DOPE and FRESH. pear and peach also GWEAT.
