i popped on npr while waiting for the toaster to be done clinking
the news was about how alabama is going to execute kenneth smith with the first ever nitrogen execution method. they didn't know if it would work. the man on there went into graphic detail about excessive pain, seizures, how the process requires the convicted to wear a mask for the nitrogen to seep under,  and how the entire process is untested. the man is enterred into being a test subject at the prize of being convicted of . the woman at the end apologized for how explicit the process of death was described.

usually make it when i'm too far gone anyways. 
the nutritional yeast is nice for b vitamins to avoid the hangover tomorrow

keeps the women away too!

## ingredients

bread - usually i use my own sourdough
butter
nutritional yeast
garlic
finishing olive oil
salt

## method


Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”

“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is an irregular, gasping breath pattern that can happen when someone is near death.

toast the bread with butter on it and garlic sitting on top
douse thick in nutritional yeast
add olive oil and salt on top
eat standing up after you smoked too much weed and it's 2 am.

## review

what is humane in death?
who am i to ask for anything?
the witnesses are saying it's horrific. the man shaking. 
Smith also “made a ‘I love you’ sign in sign language with one of his hands that was facing the room where his family was witnessing,” the journalists’ joint report said.
"humanity takes a step backwards"
general strike for gaza is just to not post your stupid fucking face on social media for a week. we are not shutting shit down.
