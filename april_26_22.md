It is dandelion season my dudes
Dad is visiting.
I am on the couch on my phone documenting
It's 2am and He coughs intermittently far off in the dark now and my carboy of fermenting dandelion flowers and dates burps just about twice as often. A race to fill the apartment with violent exhalations or the resulting "tadaaaa" of repression of natural habbit

You picking up what I'm putting down?
Havin a little snort of my own here 
It's all together up to the windows...
actually upstairs neighbor did text me saying my cooking was smelling too strongly when I did this dinner. Ha 
It was likely the two baked trouts and steamed bass. stuffed with early spring ramps and lemon and covered in butter
We're all responsible for stinking up the place I suppose
Goddam what a decent meal

Going with the dandelion wine is the greens collected just to get some different color in the bodega sunshine bag
They're bitter as hellso should be dealt with accordingly
Usually I saute them with raisins or dates but I found a leftover bottle of carrot wine in the basement when I was looking for the carboy bung feeling manic and wanted to wncorporate

---Now the fridge is adding to the cacophony another unique reflex of the night. whirring the frion round and quivering all over in order to scare away the heat
I have no idea how a fridge works. It does definitely take up space in the dark differently than smells or coughs or burps or barks



## ingredients

carrots, celery
dandelion greens - as much or more than the carrots and celery
carrot wine - white is fine otherwise
stock

## spice

coriander, long pepper, black pepper, salt


I'm going to look at one more pair of boobs on the internet and go to bed.


----update (may 2) going to do the update and write how to. its kind of basic.

## method

carrots and celery first and i cooked these down for a while
then add all the dandelion greens
add in spices, cook for just a bit.
add in about equal parts of stock and wine. it should be a decent amount... like you'll see it and make the dandelions float
cook until it boils, cover it and simmer for a long haul.
