went out for dom's bday and felt all weird this morning
i didn't drink thaaaaat much - had 3 beers and some tequila
but he did get like $150 of sushi from a shitty place in lawrenceville
and i ate a bunch - it wasn't good but it was kind of nice to be a glutton.
but my brain just wasn't firing properly on all cylinders. the mercury in the yellowtail had corroded the sparkplugs in my third ventricle

anyways brain so broken i just kept walking in circles until this came together. 


## ingredients

### savory french toast

stale bread - i had olive loaf
egg
milk/cream
onion

### lazy dandelion anchovy pesto

anchovy
dandelion
garlic
lemon


## method

### toast
mix egg and milk or cream together you can throw in some spices now - i did just s&p and some paprika. depends on what you're doing with it i guess. pour on to a plate or in a bowl, place toast on that and soak. i did this the afternoon before when i felt like cooking but wasn't that hungry yet so did it overnight. flip the bread at some point if it's on a plate. cook in a pan with lots of butter. i threw in some red onions and then salted them about 2 minutes in around the toast where there was room. keep those moving and carmelizing. flip the toast and take out when ti looks done

### pesto

rip some dandelion leaves off a weed in the garden. slap that down with whatever looks like a good amount of anchovies and garlic. hide the garlic and anchovies under the dandelion haystack. use the oil from the garlic to wet the stack a lil and then keep chopping until fine-ish - i actually liked mine a lil rough

### endo

i assembled these in a stack like this:


chevre cheese
pesto
tomato slice
carm onion
french toast
