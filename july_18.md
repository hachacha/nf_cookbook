handling this poorly
i have been thinking a lot about what it means to be spiritually dead
i think that brewing my own liquor (spirit) has spurred this 
looking at recipes for chinese things and it includes pickled things.
i picked up "pickled" mustard from the grocery store and it was full of yellow dye and weird preservatives and MSG. i got it as a time saver thinking it might still taste OK but it did not. even after a quick wash.
i think about the time i was in japan drinking STRONG for the first 3 nights because it was like less than a dollar and 9% . the day after we had jack daniels import was one of the worst hangovers of my life. poignent. 
in researching this recipe i see all the times that it calls for fermented beans - soy and broad and the way in which they are fermented - sauce and spread
the days before, because sadie brouht back 30 lbs of dairy from some random quarantine-afflicted man (not sick, just he had a truckfull of dairy and nowhere to go) that the ultrapasturized stuff is fucked. 
milk is alive
pickles are alive
vegetables are alive
meat is alive
until you process it. otherwise you are consuming the dead. you are consuming dead spirits. nothing meaninful.
what does it mean to be spiritually dead?
what does it mean when you drink naturally fermented alcohol that is near to the plae you inhibit
what does it mean when everything in your grocery cart is processed - you do not have a single living thing in there
how can you think
how can you feel
you have hair imported from jinxiang china taken from the uighyer muslims in internment camps. enslaved people 
you wear that on your head. you traffic it for a higher price in your community on facebook via dead machines
spiritually dead
you watch some jim hunt shit about how he feels things through concrete and rock and how spirits attend tothe natural aspects of the world. where do processed things fit in? how much processing has to happen before that's not a thing
imagine a world without ghosts
nothing in ikea furniture
nothing in smartphone filth
nothing in the nice condos that nobody can afford
no natural
nothin

what an intro
