driving from silver city to as far as we can go to pittsburgh
pulled in to the longhorn motel in boise city trying to make it to dodge. the main point was to go there so you could say you got out of dodge. i think it may be easier to go to a dealership and test drive a mustang or something. you like that joke?

it smelled like dogs and old carpet that's been shaken around in hot static.
by midnight not much was open so went to bed a little hungry but the morning was nice and cool and damned bright. all the house lights were on and showing off the dried dog shit between the hotel and the Love's gas station mummified at intermission. had to make some time and after being on the road with more road ahead and the sun already blinding everything was a sundry. so we ate what we had for breakfast.

## ingredients

kimchi
hard boiled eggs

## method

put the kimchi on the hard boiled egg
it would be nice if your partner was either in the room or not coming back because the smell of these two treats combined in the mortar of your mouth is not pleasant unless you're stinkin in there with it.
the bathroom doesn't have a fan anyways so you might as well relish in all of it.
