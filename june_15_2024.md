i've been making tepache. and i've been trying to make alcohol from leftover lees in tepache. it is working great. i did it once with the cider lees when i went to nyc. driving around with a burping gallon jar or pineapple and goji berries. 

this time i'm using the cucumber lees.

__normal__

## ingredients

really winged this one... let's do the regular/standard tepache recipe first whivh i've done a couple times and then the other.

1 pineapple - should probably get organic as you're not going to wash it.
2-3 cups of sugar or so.
molasses - modify the sugar if you want more molasses or less.
like .75 gallon of water - 3 quarts.
ginger root 4 inches.
allspice, cinnamon, cloves (those are the main/important ones). i've added cardamom, 


## method

disolve the sugar and molasses in the water with the spices
wait for it to cool to below 100 because i think it may kill the yeast.
cut up the pineapple small. retain the outer skin. you don't need the top or the bottom.
put it all in a 1gallon jar. cover with a rag and a rubber band for like 5 days. you shake it a little every day. it will start to smell lovely, bubble up. bubble nice. the fruit will be more at the top than at the bottom - then you'll know it's alive.

### afters
the longer that this sits around or it takes for you to drink this the less sweet it is because the yeast is voriferous and eats the sugars. beautiful really. especially engaging with it over a few days. would love to have a huge batch of this and just have a cup every day to see what it's like over time. no need to refridgerate because it's alive. goddam. 
i think one would be able bottle this and naturally capture the effervescense so long as it doesn't blow up.


__alcohol__

this one is special for the cucumber lees. for the apple cider version i just did the above and dumped in all the lees from the gallon jug of cider i had some success with.

## ingredients
1 pineapple
lees
3 limes juices
ginger
more sugar than above
cardammom, 
cucumber wine lees. 
damn i think that's really it... tried to keep it simple. 

## method
same as above

### afters
this one is already more active. on __june 18__ lots of giggly bubbles i heard last night while watching this kwazy courtroom drama movie about a slave ship directed by spielberg.
