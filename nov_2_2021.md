## real evolution of a meal

### night 1

salmon belly
cornbread
beet greens and mushrooms
roasted beets
horse radish
clam chowder

#### init

baked the salmon belly in a cast iron pan with a bunch of coconut oil and some garlic around it. it was rubbed with some nice herbs.
cornbread was standard
beet greens and mushrooms were just sauteed together
roasted beets were used for cwikla with the horse radish. 
	- boil or roast the beets, remove the skin, put in a blender with some horseradish, sugar(honey), a little raw garlic and blend it until it's creamy. it's a wonderful wonderful condiment.
megan made clam chowder it was nice to soak the cornbread in it.

#### act 2

#### act 3

i cooked this proscuito with some butter and then added the squash on in there. 
a little bit more coconut milk to make it creamier
