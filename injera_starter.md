# injera from starter experiments.


## feb 18

75g sourdough discard
100g teff
50g buckwheat
300g water

just "regular"
200g teff
50g buckwheat
380g water

## feb 21 (3 days) viz & smellz update

smells interesting
both have bubbles
did not stir either at all

sourdough one has heat to it -- definitely smwlls like sourdough starter
original/teff-only smells like an overripe fruit 

## feb 23 (5 days)

noticed color change much lighter than the teff
white film on regular in splotches banana scent is more... robust?
sourdough discard one smells very sweet

discord (DID WAY TOO MUCH)
450g starter
450g teff
300g buckwheat
1700g water

regular (did much smaller batch)
100g starter
150g teff
50g buckwheat
400g water

let both of these sit out overnight covered.

## march 4. 
the discard cooking was easier. discarded the top water and then added new water to have a bit more of a looser consistency. these were thinner, not as big of bubbles. but it worked out okay.
dark. 
not that sour. but tasted nice. had this late at night after biking for a bit in the dark. avoiding coming home.

## march 10
got drunk and shagged all day march 9. 
all sore trying to get some things done.
attempted the absit again -- gelatinization process as suggested here https://teffco.com/traditional-injera/gelatinization/
one of the tips is that this helps to make more "gluteny" as teff does not have gluten. but since i've been adding some flour i don't think this is necessary
i poured off the top water, did the gelatinization process, of putting a portion into boiling water, cooling it and then adding to the rest of the batter with more water but then the thing was too sticky again.
i did not get bubbles, and while the bottom cooked (sometimes burned) the tops remained gooey/gelatinous. 
i think i may have cooked out the yeast? the bubbles were more present when i used the discard. on march 4. i will do that again.

## march 25
just did my dad's funeral/celebration of life.
100g discard
150g teff
100g water

discard try
225g discard
150g water
50g teff

## march 27
discard sat in the oven for those days. lots of bubbles - weird whitish film on top like mold. but felt okay about it. if i hit the side of teh bowl it would make a white bubble.
tried cooking discard straight in the pan. more successful but the teff that was in there was a little "tough" could feel the granule more.
more successful as a pancake. i think i made it too watery. added more water before cooing.

just put the refresh in the fridge. lots of bubbles.
