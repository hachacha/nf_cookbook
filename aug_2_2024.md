queen anne's lace soda


24g qal
3c sugar
9c water
2 oranges

in a green gug


464g with bowl and added mugwort. but i think the scale is suddenly broken.
also some dried tulsi.

at the same time transferred out the watermelon wine
and now putting in 2 things of sage - maybe like 10 fresh leaves. and also some rue leaves and flowers.

*update nighttime aug 5*

that shit was way too sweet. either cut with sparkling mineral water or don't add as much sugar (but if not enough sugar would the yeast come alive??)


aug 7
i am doing another one i put in 15 cups of water. 3.5 cups of sugar
got like 60g of flowers but they were wet. we finally got some rain and it's cooled off nicely.
i added the top of a marijuana plant, some mugwort to this
it is great
