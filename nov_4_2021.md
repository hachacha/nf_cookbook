I've made this a few times for the last year or so and i like it a lot
it's some indian fried egg. simple.
it looks pretty cool because the tumeric colors it a wild orange yellow color all the way through. looks like a giant fruity pebble sort of. with the tips of the eggs are carmelized or crispy...  i wonder if that is carmelization or just... crispsdss...
i'll add two methods for finishing it that i like.

### ingredients

egg(s)
chilis
onion
garlic
butter
tumeric, whole cumin, black pepper

### method

melt the butter. i like a lot of butter
add the onion and whole cumin. mix around.
add chilis. mix around.
add garlic and tumeric and mix around (if you have only powdered cumin add now) (and if you have whole tumeric you can probably add that before with the chilis instead of now if it's powder... (this is a dumb way to organize this recipe))

try to corral all the previous ingredients together so that they're equally spread out and the egg can just sit on top. add the egg(s)


#### 1

on high heat get those eggs til' they're poppin,
add a little bit of water
cover and let the top of the egg and yolk cook via steam.
it's nice if you have a see-through lid, becuase once it gets a little bit white you can stop cooking them, that will be with runny yolks. the whiteness on the top of the egg yolk will correspond to how done they are.
if not, you'll have to guesstimate their done-ness

#### 2

_i just did this today_
with two eggs, if they're touching, you can flip one on to the other - yolk-to-yolk

one or both will break and then drip down the sides. it's okay if this doesn't happen.
flip the bitch. cook on the other side you should have like a mega-yolk

this was great for a bagel sandwich.

finished on top with some yogurt mixed with coconut chutney.
