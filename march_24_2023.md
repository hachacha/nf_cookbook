i did this except i added celery
and i didn't have crem phrasiishe for the dressing 
i did some heavy cream, mayo, apple cider vinegar, capers and some of their juices, pepper
probably some dill woul have been good
and soaking the onion did help make it not be so harsh, added nice texture to the "tough" horseradish
very very nice different styles of crunch

bacon and eggs and a purple potato hash on the side
