# june 27

i went camping with my friend bryan and his wife dasha.
bryan is from new jersey and went to an affluent private school. he plays monopoly with some people hwe went to school with who now work on wall street. when i described my frustration with the fact that george floyd was murdered over a "fake" printed $20 bill and just a few weeks before the federal reserve printed $2.5 TRILLION for "wall street" bail outs. he said that there is absolutely nothing significant about these monopoly players.
that they are nice and funny but not at all thoughtful. 
it makes one wonder about how you are raised. how can you be alive and not be thoughtful. what's going on in there? 

anyways

it was beautiful in west virginia during the day all sun
in the evenings on and off rain
also a girlfriend who was having constant anxiety attacks about whothefuckknows. shoeglue flu.

in the shadows of these seneca rocks i cooked hot dogs and made a salad.
the rain came in and out. we probably opened and closed the doors to the cars over a hundred times to protect cooking items from the rain.

## ingredients

the dark
the rain
cucumber
tomato
lemon
onion


5 white pork sausages

stick

## method

i started a fire and there were fireworks all around
it began raining shortly afterwards
but i kept throwing wood on there to keep the fire going through the rain
these people kept setting off fireworks
soggy sulfur
the stick i had picked up had 2 branches and i fit all five dogs on at once
it felt absurd to be cooking that many at once while squatting with a bunch of smoke in my face (rabbit) while rockets were exploding around me in a downpour.
the rockets are to celebrate what? independence? most the people in the camping store did not wear masks. two weeks later we'll see that the area had experienced an increase of 80 cases. 
what a sour time. closer to independence than memorial.
new budweiser ads.
anways after some shit with one of the tents we assembled the hot dogs in potato bread buns under a hatchback car's trunk with sourkraut and mustard. divine. bit of burnt stick in middle bites. had to put the salad away during this
basically just cut up everyting small and put it on paper plates. 
nobody really ate it because cucumbers are basically all water and we're also mostly water and we're being rained on so.
