# nf_cookbook
a nite time cook book for homoserectuses. meant to be sort of a  collaborative diary, technique sharing guide, and recipe reference. 

### ethos
- 


### background

many cookbooks are set up as indexes for different food that's set up under a specific category. 
`how do i cook an x?` look up in the cookbook, `this is how i cook x`. however, it stops there. it does not necessarily suggest that you can extend the thing you just did to other applications. recipes are static and their methods are left to wallow on that page. while this is kind of up to the reader to do what they will with this knowledge it is not encouraged that this method could be applicable to a different recipe or ingredient. the most important skill with cooking is the freedom of experimentation with different techniques and this book is a collaborative effort to foster these ideas and confidence in the reader. also i want to practice ascii art
