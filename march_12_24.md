talked to nick about the vn movie "scent of green papaya"
ended up seeing it the next day at the indian mart and picked up one

yesterday i failed to do anything much worthwhile but played some tennis and then decided to go back and make a papaya salad. which took too long. 
and i was hungry so i just ate a bunch of popcorn i made quick before. got stoned later and added ranch seasoning and nice olive oil to a bowl.
i felt pretty good after eating this. physically. mentally was on-point. despite my indifference to any tasks or chores i "should" be doing.

## ingredients

green papaya
red onion
tamarind, water, lemongrass, sugar
lemon/lime juice, garlic, hot dried peppers (could probably use fresh thai ones)
fish sauce
ground beef
nuts/seeds (i used these pepitas but they're old and actually not that good)
garnish -- parsley/clinatro/methi would probably work

## method

remove the seeds and skin from the papaya. julienne it. interesting method i saw in the movie where the girl would hold it flat in her hand, spank the sharp part of the knife on it vertically to make thin slices and then turn it sidways to shave off a layer. this would probably make for really good thin slices and consistency but my knife wasn't sharp enough and i was afraid of cutting my fingers off so i just julienned it.
here's where she does it

thin slice the onion
reserve some onion and put it in the ground beef. i had the beef frozen in a ball so i put it in a cast iron and covered it with some water in there on low while i did everything else. when i noticed it was softened a bit i would break it up with the spoon and flip it or just try to make it more...groundy. 
take some of the onion and throw it in the ground beef.
keep some raw for the salad and keep it with papaya
dilute the tamarind in heated water, add lemongrass. i had some fucked up shrimp paste from when i made bun bo hue. but it was too intense. so i tossed it. dilute the sugar in this tamarind water.
put garlic, chilis and lemon into a mortar and pestle and beat it up. 
when the tamarind water is cooled you can mix it into the bowl of veggies with the garlic lemon chili stuff.
put that on the bottom of your bowl, top with beef, garnish, and seeds.

i didn't really add any spices since this was pretty fresh tasting but i'm sure black pepper would not be offensive. 
same with soy sauce, cumin, long pepper, ginger or annatto. 
the beef i cooked in the cast iron was also cooked with leftovers from some bacon and oregano...
