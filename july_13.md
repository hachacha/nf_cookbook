used the boiled leftover carrots
if sweet potatoes make a good pie then carrots should do too, no?
dotoono


## ingredients

pie crust
	- or just make the pie crust with white flour, cold butter, little bitcold water
	- everything cold and comes together roll it out and pre bake 350 for 40 minutes it's "almost" all the way baked but i think a fully baked one would maybe do?
cup of buttermilk
bunch of boiled carrots
2 eggs
grated white onion (mine was big so i used about a fourth)
salt & pepper
oregano
tarragon


## method

chill the pre-baked crust
mix all those ingredients in a bowl while you wait for chillin
dump it in the crust and bake at 350 until the top gets a little bit brown. i think mine took like an hour total. lots of water in that thing
real good with cheddar cheese
