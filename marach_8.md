today i came home and there was a lot of little black poops on the kitchen floor. i glanced at it and my first thought was "how did a deer get in here and why did it poop?"
upon closer inspection i saw that the beans i was soaking in a glass jar had made the jar explode and it leaked all over
i made a red barron emergency frozen pizza. one should always have an emergency frozen pizza
