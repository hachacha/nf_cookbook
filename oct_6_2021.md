this time a' year man
this time uuuh yeayah!

i like the fall. i love having a garden during. onslaught of shruggy tomatoes
might as well ripen 
have hard time cutting back the nasturtiums i like watching them grow
this was simple
i stayed up 'til 4:30am last night and did a bunch of good shit today.
workwise
life is nice. 
dog days of summer don't quite remind you of that as this contrast between the crimsoning leaves making the woods look like a sour candy wrapper and these plants pumping out the last of their fruits
moons all out without haze or storm clouds. beaming.
everything feels both new and on the precipise 
	how the fuck do you spell that
	i gotta learn some greek

overall this salad is like a little creamy and cheese-ish and wonderful pops of tart n herb while stil being minimal.


## early fall nasty salad

### body

red leaf lettuce
nastirtiums - leaves and flowers
tomato
toasted garlic


### dress

nice olive oil
rice vinegar
s&p
nutritional yeast

### method

chop up the body
throw on the dress.
nutritional yeast you add last and i just did enough the dustly cover the bowl.
maybe it'd be nice to dole it out like that?
