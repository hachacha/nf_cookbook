# my collared greens

i do collareds the same tried n true way or at least i hope it is.

### MAINS
⋅⋅* collared greens
⋅⋅* red onion 
⋅⋅* garlic
⋅⋅* a really hot vinegar (like pickled pepper juice/brine) -- but any would do
⋅⋅* olive oil

### SPICE
⋅⋅* fenugreek
⋅⋅* mustard seeds
⋅⋅* kashmiri red chili powder
⋅⋅* s&p
--* fennel

oil and mustard seeds first
onions and garlic briefly
throw in the collards and then the spices
the water will start to come out wait til the leaves are shiny before adding the vinegar and cook that down just a bit
then add some stockand cover and simmer. stir every now and then
