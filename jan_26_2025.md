bunch of foods here they claim are healthy or magic
cuy supposedly cures cancer but i couldn't find any academic articles. just my prof telling me that a friend of a friend's hustband ate only cuy soup and it cured his cancer.
she gets vitamin injects, has a seratonin imbalance, was struck by lightning, only drinks once every two months becuase she had too much ethanol in her chicha in the past.
i trust her.
but another magic is the algae from the high altitude lakes.
i didn't get the spherical stuff but the big honk of aglae it's like the size of my head.
i had it for a couple days now and it's really like dredging my intestines. i am taking great shits.

## ingredients

it's cushuro... that's the name of the spherical algae but idk what i have. because it's not spherical. it'a a big dried brick
green peas
onion, celery, garlic, water full of parasites, black pepper, cumin, butter

## method

soak the peas if it's peas. if it's lentils. uhh. don't

soften and add more onion and garlic 
soften and add spices and lentils/peas
add water and keep doing so until the peas are cooked.
soften and add the algae.
