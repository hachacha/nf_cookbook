things you can hide in rice.

new things

you can hide new foods in rice while you cook it
new things to you

there's a lot of new things outside of personal norm

you run that simulation enough times to pilot the landing of a rudtabega into your denver airport of a mysterious mouth

kitchari -- gooey existensialism ascetisism. the less your body works the better
