# july 10, 2023

took a speedy pill yesterday in order to get some extra curriculars done and instead of relying on some tea and warm milk to pump the brakes toward sleep i aimed up the heaven hill bottle of whiskey until i got drowsy. today my brackets are a little loose and i'd rather have soupy listless thoughts in a wet cardboard box than manage the hard angles  of scheduling meetings within the confines of the 5 o'clock quitting whistle via smtp.
mondays, right?
this week will be a dousy. i feel some bad luck coming on. and i don't think it's just the tickling reflex of the wet cardboard box touching the back of my thigh. usually something bad happens around this time of year. i feel like i should tell someone just in case it happens so at least then i can say "see i told you so!"

define: pre-ordained
pre·or·dain
verb
past tense: pre-ordained; past participle: pre-ordained
decide or determine (an outcome or course of action) beforehand.
"you might think the company's success was preordained"

define: ordained
or·dain
verb
past tense: ordained; past participle: ordained
1.make (someone) a priest or minister; confer holy orders on.
"he was ordained a minister before entering Parliament"
2. order or decree (something) officially.
"equal punishment was ordained for the two crimes"
```

strange the top result for one is about becoming a preist and the other with the prefix is just the decision. i will tell someone of my bad luck and get ordained now. i'll be in sanctuary before the other shoe even drops.

bought this chuck roast months ago with a fantasy to do some sort of prosciutto with it. but then it got old i got busy and it got accompanied with the mrs. T's in the freezer. then i took it out and got busy again and then needed to do something with it before it went bad so i ended up using the freezer bag of veggie-ends for soup stock and just cooking it with all that and water. 
stephen was over recently and i was able to make him gumbo and saved the shells of the shrimp. that went in there too.
what a nice gumbo that was... i honestly think that may be the best way to catch up with someone. one person stirs the roux, the other chops some veggies or cleans shrimp and the entire time you just drink wine or a big tall 6 pack. i should make that more of a tradition honestly.
anyways.
the beef got simmered for like 4 hours. got some decent beefy stock out of it as well as a honk of meat.
since i wasn't really feeling like eating i ended up just making some ranch dip and eating chips with that. but i doctored it a little because i had to get rid of some veggies in the drawer.

## yesterday

### bitter melon ranch dip

1 bittermelon/gourd
2 garlic cloves
half a white onion
fresh parsley
half a bowl of weed
rosemary
greek yogurt
mayo
hidden valley ranch mix

chop the bittermelon up. chop the onion finer with the parsley and rosemary. toast the garlic and chop that finely. or chop it finely and toast it. whatever. just don't burn it. put it all together. about 2parts yogurt to 1 part mayo. you can use actual spices instead of the mix. i was pretty stoned though.

## today

### salad

red romain. or whatever.
carrots
leftover bitter melon ranch dip
apple cider vinegar
nice fruity olive oil

should be obvious. but the olive oil and the acv turns the dip more into a salad dressing. add more bittermelon or carrots or other veggies as you like. i actually put in more onion because i thought it was overall lacking in the dip :)

### meat

red onion
garlic
horse radish
vinegar or alcohol
BEEF
chile de arbol
oregano

dried chile in the pan on high heat for a bit. add some coconut oil. 
keep toasting that. add the horse radish and the thinly sliced red onion at the same time. do that until the horseradish browns a little bit. it has a nice nutty sweet flavor when you cook it like this. 
push all that to one side of the pan. i took that beef i used to make stock with and ripped it up a bit and set it in the empty side of the pan for a bit to sear it/crisp it. put in some roughly chopped garlic and oregano. mixed it all together. added apple cider vinegar and cooked it off. that was it. it was kind of sweet from the vinegar and horseradish. onions carmelized nicely. 


## eating

had a nip of gin before eating. 
i liked to take a bite out of the tip of the chile and then immediately take a bite of the beef dish. tobasco was nice with it too. reminded me of the parkway po-boy a little bit when i had it with the hot sauce.
now i'm having a weird energy drink

sorry for changing tenses in here.
