late last night i got back home in the dark after traveling from greece with a liminal intermission in connecticut.
in greece, no matter which direction you look, your line of sight spans many ages of human history. you're sitting at a cafe waiting for your coffee and in your field of vision you see people talking on their cell phones (new) in front of the roman agora (old) while drinking a beer from a can (both! the ancient egyptian recipe finding a singularly consumable sarcophogus living inside a pyramid of a fridge (too cutesy?)). The public bus you take on this "remote" island rides by old monestaries and parks overnight in an olive grove where the slow-growing trees are 4 feet in diameter. The church service for lambros, who got married there, was mostly in ancient greek, few understood what the preist had said but it was amplified from a  wireless headset to the speakers all through the church.
all these visions brought about cumulus thoughts.
immediately on leaving, that cloud in my head was stretched thin by the circadian rolling pin as we went unbathed and starkly awake traveling eastward by plane with the spin of the earth to sustain a sunny day across two hemispheres loopy on landing only to wait 2 hours in the passport control to show proof of existence. and then meeting my parents in the middle of separation and the selling of the home we all grew up in largely brought that to some darkening and low hanging reality of immediacy - the family, the body, the home. protective and polite wheels turning on if i'm ok, if you're ok, how to make sure it's ok.
still wrestling around with all of that to try to make a comfortable tapestry to lay in. writing helps obviously.
in the dark i could see that my plants were still around
one 5 foot tall plant i realized was not the ground cherries that i have failed to grow 3 years in a row from seed but wild dagga - absolutely stunned to see that in the light of my cell phone at 1am.
in the light i went back out and shirked my way through the overgrown grass to where i then thought i also planted these same seeds. only i found an ACTUAL ground cherry plant! i relished unwrapping it from it's natural lanturn casing and popped one in to my mouth. i could not help but sway and smile with the tartness on my tongue.
i came in here to write that down and now it is sufficiently dark.
