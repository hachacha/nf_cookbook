too much has happened. the last entry was really july.
i really spiraled out the other day - er 3 days. i woke up as a muffler and i needed fresh orange juice and a cappucino and a blt. i got the juice and the cappucino. at primanti's they don't have lettuce but they do have cole slaw so that was my blt. 
cried at the barbie movie on my laptop in the kitchen. didn't eat the french fries but rediscovered them around midnight -- it's like 1:30am now.

## method
leftover french fries with mayo, some dumb and old roasted chicken and sunchoke kimchi.
that's what i had. fries and chicken in the airfryer to heat up. 
i mostly followe this recipe for the chokes. i forget when i did it.

but added more of everything in the paste and left it out for longer than 2 days i think. also threw in carrots that were less than turgid. 
my liquid ratio was off but i just left it upsidedown in teh jar when i was done for a bit and everytings crisp.
im not farting a bunch rn so i assume that the sunchokes were "cooked" enough.
^actually as soon as i wrote that my gut started churning.

i had so many goddam sunchokes. just make sure to fertilize/add manure to that thing every like 2 months. let it go all the way to the frost before harvesting.
