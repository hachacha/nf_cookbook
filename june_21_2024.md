watermelon seeds
separated when adding to cucum ber es exjperient
half a watermelon gets about half a gallon maybe a little more. ehhhhh

pulled all the sees out separate

350F
fresh oregano, salt, olive oil all in a cast iron pan for long enough
was fucking around and tried frying mint earlier like one would a basil leaf for my egg salad sandwich
the fried mint goes well with the watermelon seeds
i went a bit too long ad the sugars burned a little... the fried mint should be chopped and added sparingly.
