## method

sauce
soak around 8oz or so of cashews in 32oz water for about 8+ hours or until you see the water get melky
put coconut oil in pan on high, add basil and then when it starts spitting a little bit add the tumeric.
mix it up for only a few seconds before adding the chopped onion and celery
add the garlic and serrano pepper and cook for a while, you can add salt and black pepper
throw the cashews and their water in to the pot and scrape and turn off the heat
put it all in blender
take it out and add some more water dependingon your consistency you want
cook it down a bit with the 1/4 sliced onion and the frozen pea / beans w/e
add more fresh basil when done.


boil the carrots and add the lentils and garlic eventually when they get a lil soft. you may need to dump out the water when all done
put all ingredients in to the blender
you may need more water or bread depending on consistency.
i didn't have eggs so i kept adding nutritional yeast until it kind of held together. it still didn't really work.
turn in to balls
fry on the oil
