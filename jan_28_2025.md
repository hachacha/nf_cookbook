i'm in cusco.
every food is foreign to me here. i walk on three wheels down the cobblestone streets need my hoof split in two like a llama to manage really  ^ i read the chalk signs de la menu de dia and sure sometimes i know the meat but not the whole thing - all foreign.
finally escaped host situation where i was unable to cook at all . free to use anything in the kitchen but th stove, oven, fridge and cutting board. great place to piss.

simple meals here
remind me of prague. i never wrote an entry for that but i remember. airbnb with only salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar. 
market at the end of the block  and we manage. the most basic meal in these situations

oily/greasy meat / butter (bacon, salt pork, sausage)
onion, garlic
AN HERB - then it was dill, now it is muna y oregano
another vegetable . 
bread and cheese.

similarly to ToC

i'll do a here and there

first 3 days cusco with a kitchen
onion, avacado , eggs
smiles in the market. being called papi is something i like. it's like a single step away from formality with senor. but i wonder what the 24-28 year olds get.
coca , butter,,, tough celery, mangosmangos,  a couple spicy peppers, garlic!, random other fruit
big dense salty white cheese. bag of bread that was only 80 cents. 
each of those breads is a different size and weight and some have a burn mark on the bottom. it made me weak in the knees seeing that. the homemade the mistake like a kiss on the forehead temporal and grounding and affectionate.

## how

just make eggs with it. do it in silence
bend the one tong on the fork back into position
relative silence; the food is making noise in the sarten. 
become accustomed like a forehead kiss.
keep eating the bread with a slice of cheese and covered in honey. it's a wonderful salty sweet combination.
