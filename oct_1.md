we had some frozen ground red meats. have a pelthora of frozen exotic in my freezer.
a rabbit, ground antelope, ground goat, ground beef(not so exotic), a tentacle, bagelman bagels.
had thawed some because was going out to vancouver. i'm in the vancouver airport now revisiting this and wanted to get down my recipe for thees lentils i did that were realy good.

### MAINS
⋅⋅* ground beef
⋅⋅* crimini mushrooms 
⋅⋅* red lentils
⋅⋅* a lime


### SPICE
⋅⋅* s&p

BEEF
wanted to maybe use this for stuffing something. would have been good with nuts.
- threw it in the pan with oil. wante to keep it kind of bland and simple despite wanting to get it all sweet. we had the goat the day before and did that kind of sweet and bakey-spicy. 
- garlic onions and some chilis went in there at the same time after a second
- lot of water released and i put in a bunch of spinach that was going bad
- at this point i took some of this liquid and put it in with the lentils and mushrooms

LENTILS
- cook the criminis dry on the cast iron
- when they start to shrivel and release water put in the lentils and butter and keep mixing it around until they're coated and maybe you can imagine that they're toasting. i don't know if that really happens.
- dump in the beef broth that you are cooking above and keep adding water or broth until it's cooked to a consistency you like
- add in the juice of a whole lime. i think i put in something else acidic/tart but don't quite remmber. maybe it was just more citrus. but the mushroom + citrus + butter was a really nice and light combination. almost like the feeling you get when eating a keylime pie or something.
