everything's hard and i keep getting secret drunk like now
virtually isolated and on gaurd 
wanting to reach out in a million directions but each branch/yearning takes from the others and all end up failing
i need to be pruned proper

i winged together a zuccini dish i wanna expand on
have been staring at screens way too much and this weird tunnelvision develops where i can't really tell if i'm looking at anything at all.
overmediated i keep having to be stimulated while working on something unstimulating i leave the desk and find that i can't even focus on getting water and just walk around like having an out of body experience
i went on a bike ride to snap out of it.
also got a pack of cigs because that usually forces me to sit and just keep a fire going
remind me to look in to smoking mullen without becoming a lenape or hippiejedidouchebag
surprised i can't find any on the tracks atm just thistle
anyways
zuccini i was going to look at another screen for some recipe inspiration but decided to look through several cookbooks instead
with z being at the end ofhte alphabet it's easy to go to the index because of course all these fucks got a zuccini recipini
one was for some cheese shit, one was a ratatouille, one was for tacos with a dill sauce and chickpeas, one was for some sort of walnut and honey salad
so i combined some elements from those


## ingredients

zucchininini
thyme, oregano,basil, allspice, s&p
garlic
green onions
walnuts
parmesian
stock or water
squash flowers



## method

cut the zuchini in to disks
put them disks in to a cast iron pan, toss with olive oil, s&p and allspice. use your hands. arrange them stacking around the pan like a little lip on lip on lip so you make a nice patty. bake at 350
scallions and garlic get broiled in oil s&p until burned a little bit
toast the walnuts
put scallions and garlic and walnuts in to blender with some stock or water (just a little little bit), blend with oregano, thyme
when the zewcheenee is a little soft take it out and dump the sauce on top
on top of that put chopped fresh basil and some parmesan - or skip parmesan it doesn't do too much there's enough in there
i also put squash flowers on top because i have those in the fuckin garden
broil until it looks good = cheese brown or flowers wilted+toast-ish looking

keep it in the cast iron and eat that with a spoon over the oven while you wait for fucking ever for the lasagna and realize you were able to focus on something other than a screen.
