good morning 
joke with the meat man
get a big peach box
offer to drive
drive
come back and make an attempt at the peach wine
we'll see if this works
i am going to rely on the natty yeast and see if this works
it's exciting to see if i can harvest a spirit. make essence out of life.
in a front-stage spiritually dead time
i think there's some spirits out there or behind there
quashed in our consumption
this is more like documentation than a recommendation for recipe. idk what the fuck i'm doing

## ingredients

5lbs of peaches
2cups sugar
juice of half a NICE grapefruit
handful of raisins
2qts of water

## tools

5gal bucket

## method

rip n tear peaches in to 5 gallon bucket removing pitts and stems.
i tried to "be careful" about some moldy pits but i am certain that those things still made it in
like these are little tiny mold particles
pour in water, grapefruit juice, raisins and then mix.
cover in the basement with a towel and then i guess we'll see what happens.
i guess i'll have to update this.
