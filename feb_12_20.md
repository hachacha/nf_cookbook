a wednesday fit.
i realize that means outfit now. but no this was a continual spasm all day
feeling internally sheepish by the end of 3 hours of meetings i wanted to fuck up the kitchen
i had tried purchased squid ink months ago for halloween to try to get a spooky green goin for a different event. went to 8 places and the 7th place was sold out. the other 7 did not carry it (macaroni factory in the strip (it's cuddlefish ink (apparently they have 3d vision, and can watch avengers end game with the glasses on and evacuate their tentacle on to the screen to get a taste of big budget just like humans)))
so

spaghetti squash
majoram, s&p, garlic, bayleaf
hollowed side down oil and baked at 350 til you can pierce with fork

chick peas & spaghetti squash seeds
cumin, paprika, s&p, mustard oil & ghee

brussels
mint, p&then s, maple syrup, garlic
cook these with big ol honks of garlic don't add salt until they start to char. i saw on some other vid on the internet for sourdough that if you add salt it forces whatever the salt is on to release water (makes sense: proscuito, preserving meat, etc) so if you want a char in the pan, don't add salt. add maple syrup and mint after you have thems resting for a bit as to not wilt the mint. it basically tastes like a sulphur mille-feuilled watermellon.

chard w/ink
anchovy, garlic, red onion, chard, squid ink, some vinegar, some thing hot and briney, fenugreek, s&p, fennel
uhhh anchovies chopped real small and then put in first with some of their oil, then garlic and onions on that, let it release, put in a big long spicy green pepper diced. mix it up. throw in the chard. you have overfilled the pan. fuck. cook it down. you forgot to was hthe chard. take it out. hurt your hands run hands and chard under cold water. put it back in. put in the spicies, add the vinegar -- in this case i had some leftover pickled ghost pepper that was a gift from a, probably, sadistic friend. so i threw that oil in and then put in one of the peppers. i just wanted it in there for like a minute and i'd take it out oafter more wilting. throw in like a teaspooon of ink. a little goes a long way. keep mixing it around until you are tired of doing it (5 minutes).

fried egg
