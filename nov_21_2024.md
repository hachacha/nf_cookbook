this one is from a dream.
stephen came to visit for about a week he brought lots of wine which we imbibed and all the different yeasts and cultures really churned me.
he woke up and told me this elaborate dream. part of it was him cooking a whole chicken in concord grape wine with 40 cloves of garlic. so i did that.


## ingredients

a chicken (nice if you can get it with the offal)
mirpoix (celery, onion, carrot chopped fine)
tulsi
rue
sage
concord grape wine
a lemon
3-4 heads of garlic
salt and pepper and butter
broccoli rabe
parsnip

## method

stuff and truss the chicken put in a head of garlic with the top off, a bunch of tulsi, half a lemon and then rub the skin with butter and salt and pepper. you can put some under the skin too :)
truss that. 
i used a cast iron dutch oven. sear it on all sides. it's very awkward to do this and i just kept having to wash my hands.
preheat the oven to 350. or whatever. if it's lower then you probably get more tender chicken but uhhh whatever.
the finer you chop the mirpoix the more flavor, really.
put that in there and attempt to soak up some of the charred skin that is in the pan. add all the rest of the garlic cloves. don't bother to chop them it would take too long. you already spent all that time peeling it, right? right???? then dump in the wine.  cook it down a bit. the liquid should cover like half-most of the chicken. add stock if you need to make it go further. put the chicken back breast-down -- flip it later on. put it in the oven with the lid on it and check it some times. chicken needs to be at like 160 for it to be "done"
when it's done remove the chicken and then cook it down a bit more. add broccoli rabe and sliced parsnip to the rue goo. and cook that covered on medium until those veggies are done. 

it was the first time in forever that i bought a bottle of liquor and i talked to it a bit too much while i was making this. watched the steelers lose to the browns. talked to my sister on the phone. and also then sent some stupid cryptic shit to my ex :<

thank you for making stephen's dreams come true!
