alright i want to try hoppers.
considering doing this while on the ferment kick. i have this purple sake brewing and i know that you're supposed to use toddy as part of the process for hoppers so why not try to isolate this and continue the ferment onwards. like a sourdough starter but for hoppers. that would be fun, no? probably a good present for mom and dad.
fuck i have to get aug and reba that calvin and hobbes comic.

this video is nice

2 cups of rice in a tea cup
i already fucked up and only soaked for 3.5 hours. it wasn't enough to soak the rice enough

i added half a can of coconut water 
a ladleful of the brewin sake and then some leftover from anotehr container with some additional water -- probably needed more sakestuff
coconut flakes - about one cup
additional water
sugar (jaggery) and some salt
blend blend blend

letting it sit overnight now. i noticed it was still chunky i'm going to blend it again tomorrow. after more soaking.
