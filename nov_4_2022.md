i got a whole chicken it was wrapped tight and full of water and it took about 10 paper towels to slough it off
graciously provided were the livergizzardandneck
had to do something with it before it went bad so i made some liver and onion for breakfast 


## ingredients

chicken liver
onions
garlic
capers
butter
wine



## method

throw in the butter and forget about it until it melts. i'm still figuring out this burner so it was forgiving
take this time to remove the icky parts of the liver that are weird and stringy and fatty. i did this in a gross way just with my hands because i didn't want to dirty another cutting board but it was sort of cathartic to just use grip strength and brute force.
put the liver in the butter and flip it once you see it is turning that weird cooked-liver gray like pate
have your onions chopped fine and garlic chopped not as fine. i guess by eyeballing it the onion pile was like 1.3 times larger than the liver -- both uncooked at the time.
i smashed the liver down and just tried to mangle it some more. 
i threw the onions and garlic into one corner and had the liver in the other. wasnt' really thinking. i probably should have seared the stuff and then put the onions to staunch the brown on the pan but whatever.
get them all mixed up. everyone shrinking and carmelizing in unison spinning around the pan that's too big with too much butter
add in a couple generous glugs of red wine - kevin had something nice called "aqui" 
when that reduces and you don't smell the alcohol in the steam then add like a tablespoon of capers and whatever juice falls out of the jar.
i added taragon and pepper and some salt at this point and had it meld for another minute or two.

kevin said it tasted like christmas when i served it on toast. pretty dope

through writing down this method i learned that i can't avoid abusing a liver. perhaps it's because last night i didn't drink and i had to make sure someone was responsible for that?
