continuing my recent love affair with escarole is a pairing with an affiliation of tasting bitter things. gin, abstaining from eating, bittergourd, memories read off a monolith, fenugreek.
the ingredients here don't sound like it's going to make for that much of a pleasant experience for whoever kisses you afterwards so make sure you've either got a prenup or cupid's arrow is burried up to the fletching. dill is the difference-maker here, as is cooking the anchovies and garlic to be nuttier more than salty. appeal to your lover with that.
i'd like to try charring the escarole... i don't know if that will work because of the water content but i guess people do it with romaine, mane
i've also found that pairing dill and cumin is really really nice. 

## ingredients

### base
1/2 escarole
1 whole red lettuce
dill
grated white onion

### dressing
garlic
anchovies
lemon
prosciutto
cumin
olive oil


## method

make proscuitto small. i get mine in a big hunk from the place in oakland 
chop the garlic and anchovies together in a pile so they're blended on the cuttingboard
proscuitto first, then cumin, then garlichovy in the pan.
dump that in to the rest of the base ingredients, more olive oil and lemon juice should be in there. that's it.
