going to make a sourdough here. 
maybe make sure every trip taken is long enough to make a sourdough starter there. it would probably be unique to that place, ingredients, taste, water, etc.
i dunno if i have enough of a discerning palette [sic?] to really tell.

https://www.tasteatlas.com/machica
going to get either of these two things. today i got 3kg of harina de trigo (regular ap flour i think.) its way too much. metric kicked my ass today.

machica is what they use to make chicha and sounds like a mix of grains. if it's good enough to ferment for chicha or other drinks it should be good enough for bread. i think i will try to find that first.  i wonder if i have to go to the mall i've been hearing so much about.

i have about 3 weeks left in this house and i think that's enough time.


maybe dry it out and bring it home. 

i'll follow this recipe
https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-starter-recipe/
and do 50/50 for the starter. but maybe not for the bread.

day 1
just finished at 12:45am . wrapped in a piece of plastic that had the other bread in it. now tucked under my sweaty shirt from the gym with jessica rabbit riding a stealth bomber on it. they're in the sun room/porch area. hopefully it doesn't get too hot or whatever in there.

day 2
i got drunk avoiding a thunderstorm in some tourist bar. got a weird drink that was hot and green with pisco and fernet -- antigripa -- i assume good for colds but it was just a weird strong green drink.
just before this i got some harina de chicha (i think) they wouldn't call it machica but said it's FOR chicha. i was with my teacher and she supervised a bit. she said it's good to put in yogurt in the morning. i didn't say what i was going to do with it. she ended up buying like 30 prickly pears and gave me 6 she had two flimsy plastic bags. 
anyways i didn't discard but just added more water and the machica... eyeballed. i was drunk.

day 3
just stirred it at 11am. i will probably come back this evening and do a feed.

day 4
i didn't feed when i got back. i didn't get back until like midnight.

day X (feb 21)
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i'm sorry but i neglected writing here.

on the night of feb 6 is when i baked the first bread. feb 7 was to be my last day with my professor anna duenas. i mentioned i was making this masa madre by way of mentioning that i had made my own crackers with the discard -- we were talking about food i think. she made a joke about how i didn't share it so i decided to bring her some on the last day.
this was a little tricky because this place has nothing to measure with, the oven does not have numbers and is just lit by a pilot light that sometimes goes out. you gotta get the perfect amount of gas in there otherwise it peters out after 5 minutes somehow. sort of terrified of blowing myself up with these things. knock the propane tank the wrong way with the broom and go to bed and then you have accidentally caused a landslide because the side of the house exploded above a support beam. 
anyways. i basically went by feel and sight based on the nytimes/food52 sourdough/tableloaf recipe i have been using forever. 

> 700white,300whole, 750 water (i think?), soak, 200 starter, 20salt, knead for 10 minutes, fold for a day, shape and sit in the fridge, bake at 500 in a dutch then finish 450 duthc no lid.

this flour held a bit more water than i was used to so in the second half where you are just doing the quarter folds every 45 minutes it had a lot of slap to it like non-newtonian fluid. but it was still holding together. it was difficult to measure in the water. 
i didn't leave it in the fridge but out on the counter thinking it would rise even more. 
it did a bit the next day and in the morning i woke up early despite staying up super late hand-writing a letter to anna. i guessed how hot, i threw in some water on to the metal and the oven groaned and creaked as it rapidly changed size because of the temp difference. the steam blew around the loaf and hardened the crust a bit on top.
i had it in there for a solid 45 minutes and took it out. it was still a little underdone but maybe we can just call it... chewy! it tasted heavenly. i ate a quarter of it standing in the kitchen in the morning light and fawning over the butter melting into the airpockets.
i brought anna the crackers and half the loaf and she didn't mention it later other than a thank you.
she said my letter was very nice and i have a beautiful soul lol.
