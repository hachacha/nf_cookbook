i had a whole day
last night i fed this starter and got drunk and it was overflowing
overflouring
if you will

and hten after i got it all ready and watered i realized i had no flour i liked.
since my gf had just moved out of her place and inherrited a bunch of vegan and gluten free shit from her roommates she had some almond flour, oat flour and something else i'm forgetting. but it doesn't really matter just a whole bunch of mixed up flour

i ended up using rye, almond, some sugar and the water and sourdough for this one bread that i turned into lil' mounds and that was nice. some raisins in there.
basically 3/1 ratio of flour stuff to water+leaven. you can't go wrong.
let it sit around for like a half day.

it's easy to do this. 

i feel like there's something i'm missing. i started writing this  over a week ago and i'm just back at it now.
