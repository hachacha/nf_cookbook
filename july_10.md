it's been emotional
she keeps saying she wants to break up
right now she's getting tattoo'd to cover up some other tattoo
what a vicious cycle
what a juvenile american expression
sure it means things in other cultures. but i can't help but think about americans and some psychology today article. cutting, eating disorders, both are methods of demanding respect and ownership of your own body. tattoos are the same sort of expression. an expression of an oppressed. perhaps of the self. how to know if you're truly oppressed?
at least this is how i feel now. an absurdist imperialist practice that has relation to the self but only if you're willing to plan. who doesn't have a fucking tattoo? a manufactured scar to decry something about your self.

anyways
while they were out

## ingredients

rice
ghee
garlic & onions
other garlic :)
celery
dried pepper
s&p
broth
papaya
carrot
habanero
that japanese crunchy rice topping

## method

i'm alone and i start at 2pm 
put in ghee and then the rice. cook for a minute on high
add the garlic and onions
add the broth and celery and the dried pepper -- i used ancho
add s&p
once it starts to boil turn it down to simmer and cover
meanwhile
	chop raw garlic, habaero, papaya, carrot(thin) 
put rice in a bowl
this meanwhile part should be added on top like a sick-ass salad topping to the rice
and then add that japanese crunchies thing

i feel
