about to leave for virginia for thanksgiving. going to trade cars with my mom so i can pack more efficiently getting things to the storage unit or moving things out of here. big furniture you know.
found a plastic bottle of the queen anne's lace soda (august 2, 2024 entry) that i made and forgot about in the backseat when i was cleanin up for momma. 

```
Daucus carota is often known as Queen Anne's lace there. Anne, Queen of Great Britain is the Queen Anne for whom the plant is named.[14] It is so called because the inflorescence resembles lace, prominent in fine clothing of the day; the red flower in the center is said to represent a droplet of blood where Queen Anne pricked herself with a needle when she was making the lace

## ingredients

queen anne's lace soda (aug_2_2024.md)
2009 honda crv

## method

make the soda
drink like half of the bottle and then forget about it in your 2009 honda crv for 3 months. 
when you open it to pour what you thought would be rancid contents into the sink before disposing of the vessel the air will shreik out violently and pleasantly -- unlike a cork popping, a can of tennis balls schlucking, or a regular polar seltzer water fssssssss.
then you smell it to make sure it isn't actually rancid. then you drink.

this was still reminiscent of the original soda but far more complex, the lemon (or maybe i used citrus? can't remember since i made the soda a couple times with basic variations) became more prominent and tasted like melted citrus candy. overall like the best white claw i've ever had. definitely some alcohol in there. i was in a hurry to get out the door and a drank it fairly quickly could feel it nipping at the back of my throat on the way down like a playful dog on a felt coatsleeve.
