# may 7

i stayed inside for most of the day and then felt like i was trippin some BALLS when i went out for the golden hour. just to putz by the train tracks and stare down a deer.
lil ho don't go near my jardin.
i had popcorn late and then popcorn again and felt like a popcorn all evening and skipped dinner.
ended up with a hankering to not be sitting and to make some thing at like 11:30pm
sadie said the "spiny melongourd thing was getting soft"
it wasn't really but no matter the seed was planted

### ingredients

i used 1.25 bitter gourd (i like the spiky kind because it's cuter and weirder. funky forest.) 
a sweet potato
ginger
4 garlic
3 cups whole wheat flour --it may have been 4 but then you need some for dusting
cumin
tumeric
s&p
ghee/oil

i think more spices could have been used but w/e. it's a bread so didn't want it too wild.

### method

boil the potato and the garlic until the potato is soft
you better keep those skins on you coward
chop the bitter gourd as fine as you can and then blanch it. to save on pots i just used the same water that the potatoes boiled in.
mash the potatoes and the garlic and try to drain as much of the water from the gourd
put the mashed, the gourd, the spices, and the ghee/oil all in a bowl and mush it all. add the flour a little bit at a time until it all comes together and is not a shaggy thing sticking all over but more like a lump of clay. it should be easy to rip smaller pieces off.
pull off some lime-sized balls
roll them out
heat them in a heavy bottom pan with some oil -- a little goes a long way.
flip it and see all the little brown bimples on it. very handsome. the only thing you really need to cook here is the flour otherwise you'll be farting a lot. well you'll probably be farting a lot anyways. i'm farting a lot right now. might be the popcorn though.

#### splutter

i ate it with yogurt and mint chutney while watching this brittish lady cook "simple foods" alone in her kitchen so she can spend more time with her family.
dunno why she couldn't spend time with her children inside her kitchen or have them help... they also kept talking about mindfulness while doing simple tasks like mixing by hand with a whisk. why do all these worlds seem separated? perhaps that's the symptom of having multiple devices that do the same shit and distract from the overall. computer, phone, tablet. very separate from knife, bowl, oven.
i guess it's just like other netflix branded shows where there's a formula -- something cool/nostalgic, something violent, some sex, some struggle, more sex, more violence, something cool, multiple very distinct storylines that don't necessarily converge but are meant to hold the interest of the viewer who is likely on their phone, more sex, something supernatural, violence, end. -- just hit the keywords and it'll be binge-able.
