alcohol-blitzed myself
watching the bachelor
rachel will probably win. or at least i think she's got his eye.
all this stuff about mortality
dead deer over the weekend
weird ciculicar patterns in my life. appealing to someone and trying to raise them up to get burned. could be that i get myself in to these situations because i believe this is what i deserve. deserve. want. need. desire. need some thermometers


## ingredients

red lettuce
rose water
cumin, black jeera, carraway
red onion
sunflower seed
oil and lime
capers


## method

it's a salad
toast the seeds
chop everything and put it together and toss
just a glug of the rose water.
half a big lime juice
i didn't even salt and pepper this and it's nice
i drank 3 beers real fast.
