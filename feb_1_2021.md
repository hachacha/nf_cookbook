alcohol-blitzed myself
watching the bachelor
rachel will probably win. or at least i think she's got his eye.
all this stuff about mortality
dead deer over the weekend. entire ass was eaten by a coyote. or coyotes. didn't get their numbers.
weird ciculicar patterns.
deserve want need desire gotta get some thermometers.
i ate this with a turkey and blue cheese sandwich and about 2 pbr
big idea is the rose water.

## ingredients

red lettuce
rose water
cumin, black jeera, carraway
red onion
pepitas
oil and lime
capers


## method

it's a salad
toast the seeds
chop everything and put it together and toss
just a glug of the rose water.
half a big lime juice
i didn't even salt and pepper this and it's nice
i drank 3 beers real fast.

### update

i ate this as leftover the next day again with a roast lamb leg that i got the recipe from here: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7664-leg-of-lamb-north-indian-style i would recommend more adding a lot more cardomom and coriander than this recipe
it was great pairing
