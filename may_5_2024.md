cucumber wine

6 clementines juice
2 lemons
about 6lbs english cucumbers
about 5lbs sugar.

going to add more probably. after the liquid/juices come out more

# may 6
i added maybe another half pound of sugar
the water that came out with the cucumbers was up to the 1gl line
added water until 2.5gl line.
added juice of 2 more clementines
and the ...red star yeast that's in the blue package. "premier cuvee" half of a packet. i can do a celery wine with the other one `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
it is around 70degrees in the house
the bucket is blurping

smelled today. really going off.
it is fairly clementine-forward. a little mustyness of cucumber but i think it will clear up eventually. still initial ferment.

# may 16... i think
writing this on may 29. trying to remember when did this
left it in the bucket with the lid and everything 
transferred over to two carboys. hand squeezed everything. no cheese cloth just wiped things off pretty well.
the next day i left for texas. half an hour before a tornado touched down near the highland park bridge. jeffery came over and showed me archie comics he found and gave me a meat grinder for some reason.
cheers

# june 14 - fuckin' flag day
bottled.
a little thick - maybe i should have shaved off the skins?
reminiscent of pickle. sort of a shame but truly what was i expecting? alcoholic spa water? just get vodka and infuse with cucumber... or seltzer with cucumber and add vodka. 
maybe that will come off in age. definitely cucumbery though. 
excited to try again in what will surely be a sweltering september full of too much life. the winter culled little this year so fungus, mites, slugs, lantern flies etc. are in full force. this is probably what happens in hawaii or other tropical places every year. but there are countermeasures to kill and manage those things that are expected. a warm winter is becoming more expected-- pittsburgh area just got upgraded to a new hardiness zone. checks and balances and officiating to change where the balance is. we'll have to roll with it. like this cucumber wine may be better off as an accompanyment to some ginny and briney thingy. or for marinades.
