# may 2

i spent the whole day outside gardening or buying things for gardening
told my landlords about the mouse problem
i think i killed like 10 in the last two months
i hear them fighting or loving every night
it's all squeaks
i see their remnants everywhere and i can't do anything about it
they are too light for the traps and don't set them off
in the garden i don't see any of their traces and it's repreive from sitting in front of this spew of electromagnetivity en hunk of silicon 
in the weeds 
but i do find a lot of glass
the soil is clay, glass and worms
it'll work i think
the species of tired you feel after the sun is on you all day is invaluable
it is a shame that i don't feel this that often and how much it reminds me of childhood
it's a false tired because there's always room for more play and sunshine

## WHY
i wanted to make this and i was teetering on making it american southern style because i wanted okra but also wanted some heat and some indian-ish stuff in there. so to achieve this i did half the spices in the okra without drenching it or using un-american ingredients (save for the curry leaves, but who would notice that?)
 
## how

everything i used (subs in quotes)

### ingredients

mustard oil & olive oil (whatever neutral oil or not. it don't mater)
frozen tbone steak
s&p

okra
curry leaves (a bayleaf)
garlic
fennel seeds

brown basmati rice (whatever rice. you better have brown if you want to shit or care about your brain)
dried salem gundu pepper (whatever dried pepper)
fenugreek/methi leaves (spinach, some easily wilted shrinky leafy)
bay leaf
mustard seed
clove
oil (butter)
beef stock (water)
s&p

white onion (would have used red. if using red probably use less)
a lemon (just vinegar)
rice vinegar (more lemon / some other vinegar)
medium heat chili pepper - used some green medium length ones (whatever chili. or none!)
ginger
s&p
star anise
lil cinnamon

### method

rice
oil, mustard, dried gundu pepper (these are hot don't use all that many. it's rice afterall), cloves in a pot
mix it until just before the mustard pops
pour in rice and mix it so it's covered in oil and shiny for a few minnutes
add in stock or water, salt and pepper, bay leaf
after the water goes down enough you can pour in the methi leaves. i use the stalk and everything just chopped up small because it will cook down and soften.

steak
pour the oil in a cast iron pan and try to scrape off the ice crystals from the frozen steak.
the oil should be a little deep so that it can go up the crags of the steak and cook all of that. like have it so its turns the corner around the edge of the steak.
be careful because you could flare up and cause a fire. 

``` 
I was worried about this when i was cooking because i stuffed the portion behind the stove with steel wool. that shit can really catch on fire. i accidentally got some in an electrical outlet and it wouldn't stop burning. would be absolutely fucked if that happened. so be careful.
```

sear both sides
put salt and pepper on both sides out of the pan and on a rack.
place rack in oven at 275 and cook until the internal temp is like 125 for medium rare.
this is actually really nice with a tbone because the fattier side is _super_ tender and basically melts in your mouth while still being very pronounced as steak

okra
dump out some of the oil from the steak pan. 
be quick here
put in curry leaves and whole fennel seeds for just a few seconds in the oil so they're toasted
pour in the okra and garlic -- ratio should be like 4:1
stir it for a while. that's it really. should be a little brown. pour in salt. i don't remember adding pepper

indian-ish topping
white onion chopped small, ginger chopped small, chili chopped kind of small, juice of one lemon, some rice vinegar, ground star anise, ground cinnamon, black pepper
