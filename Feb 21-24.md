made polenta
put water down in a pot and got it hot, threw in salt. added cornmeal a little at a time making sure there were no clumps
considered throwing in a bunch of other stuff but ended up not. 
just kept going until it was thickish and bubbling up and volcanoing out all dangerous. put on low and covered. got distracted by the computer for about 30 minutes while stirring intermitently. i don't know exactly how long it took but i threw in some butter and some parmesan eventually. 
figured i was going to fry this the next day because i am going to the conservatory with sadie and want her to eat this.
i mainly had pretzels and some ranch mix in mayo and FULLFAT greek yogurt.

got back at like 9:30 and didn't eat until like 11
butter with taragon and garlic i cooked
refried the cold polenta in it. i tried freezing it so it'd hold its shape but that didn't work so well. i need to mess with the temp of the pan. also covering it was a bad idea becuase the water got trapped and it all spat and didn't crisp. figured it out 3 cakes in.
made quick fake-ass italian sauce with 5 tomatos from cans with juice in frying pan, bay leaf, black pepper, garlic-whole or like the size of pinkytoenails. cook that down for a while and tup in capers. 
crack eggs and cover and cook and don't touch. was a little weird because two eggs cooked fast and the last one was draggin behind. i think it was moved off the burner but didn't realize. easily grabbed the other two out and just cooked that one section longer.
mustard green salad -- thought it was kale in the store but didn't really pay attention. it was kind of nice and a little spicy. radish, pumpkin seeds, apple, vinegar and oil and massage and some red onion.

take 2 wit the polenta re-fried. 
can of kippers
sweet potato with garlic in a skillet, collared greens fast and right behind in the same pan.
kippers are great and smokey and you eat them outta the can no cleanup.

late night snack
1am
after the squirrel cage tried to do a mushroom cheese sauce with crostinis and the brussel and nut thing.
rest of the taragon butter with garlic, MORE BUTTER, a bit of flour, a bit of flour, whisk whisk
clean mushrooms while that's on low, keep whisking til it's like a roux. throw in the mushrooms, and had those cook around while doing the brussels and having the thin sliced bread in the oven. 
the mushrooms kinda soaked up a bunch of the butter so i added more oil in it was thicker than i wanted and then i threw in this porcini that i picked up from delallos while out at greensburg earlier 7/10

leftover cheeseburgers from some shitty restaurant in greensburg. they were pretty big and we couldn't finish the whole thing so both had half and took our halves to go. resulting in two cardboard coffins with cold fries and one whole burger added between the two. they made the car smell like fat and meat which seemed to progress into fart each time we got back in to the car on the drive back.
i didn't want to eat more fat because i had indian buffet for lunch. 
i ended up having more fat in the end.
washed off the burgers of their ketchup and cheese and bread and chopped up fine with garlic, hot tiny peppers, ginger, basil, chinese celery, red onion and some toasted rice with cumin and black pepper and indian chili powder. toasted the rice until it smelled like popcorn and then ground it up kind of in the mortar and pestle. i didn't do that good of a job
threw it all in a pan with fish sauce and cooked it until it didn't just smell like shitty hamburger and more like celery and basil
cookd the rest of the rice that i toasted with just some water.
had mung beans as well. cooked with a knob of garlic chopped into thirds skin-on it don't matter, some garlic cloves, bay leaf and 3 plugs of cloves. the regular cloves realy make a difference. finish with a hunk of butter and it's basically a dessert.
