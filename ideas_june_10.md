- cook a whole cabbage like a pork shoulder / roast brisket
- week long menu where one or multiple elements are snowballed into one another through different courses in each meal. 
	ie
	- steam some lotus root
		- use the leftover water for sprouting mungbeans
	- cook a duck, cook something else in the fat
		- carcass used for broth for rice or somethin later on
	- cut up pineapple for dessert
		- keep the rind leftover for tepache for later in the week
			^ can use this as vinegar or an acid to cook or marinate other things
-marshmallow dessert with more collagen -- maybe serve chilled. 
	- hope for texture like whipped cream maybe.  
	- instead of getting gelatin powdered use just cooked down bones from home.. ? 
		^ see how marshmallows originally were made. it was probably bones and mallow plant, no?
	- does the mallow plant thicken? or is it just the collagen.
		- cook bones to make savory - savory beef bone and rosemary marshmallows
