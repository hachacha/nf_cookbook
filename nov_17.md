i'm in new mexico so i can hear myself better
the internet is shit
nothing really works
1/3 of the state has covid-19
a lot has gone wrong. technically. and is breaking. or just i do something and the solution falls short or causes another problem. 
at least the sun is still firmly up there. moon looks like a nail clipping in the firmament
it'd probably be nice to be coddled but we'll keep barrelling through this episode til porky comes up and stutters

the airbnb i'm in has 5 couches and 4 beds and i think 2 of the couches are pullout. The decorations in here are probably from a single trip to the thrift store. 
spices are just the blends or mixes that (hot take) I feel exude laziness or require hot sauce afterwards.
lemon pepper, garlic salt, slap ya mama, "grilled chicken seasoning" -- other blends that are some combination of onion powder, garlic powder, paprika. these spices were probably sitting in there for a while because they've turned in to sedimentary rocks. gotta beat them against your palm to loose a few granules.
this was a basic meal. nothing fancy but i had fun cooking it. i love cooking in a strangers house with some limitations. it's how iron chef should be run anyways-- a shitty knife, a duck-shaped tiny cuttingboard, burners that are only on high no counterspace.

saw on pbs they had something about "the three sisters" of "native" cooking. which is corn, beans, and squash. you get everything you need from that nutritionally. overall it's fitting. trying to hear myself better anyways. 

## ingredients

dried pinto beans
spinach
honey
NM chili pods
garlic
cumin

onion
serrano peppers
mexican squash (anything zuchini like works)
oregano
the butter/ghee


## method

### beans

soak them beans! i probably used 3 fistful of dried beans. i noticed remnants of burlap in there. that was cute.
to cook cover with an inch of water
put in garlic that's roughly chopped
i used 3 peppers of the dried New mex chilis. chiles?
squirted in some honey. i think i used a touch too much because when i tasted it it was pretty sweet but that disappated and melded pretty well. so give it like a tablespoon sized squirt or so? 3~ seconds
monitor how they cook. i added cumin seeds when it was about 3/4 done.
when you think they're basically done throw some spinach on top and mix it around. cover and have it steam in there. open and evaluate. you know what you're doing. good job!.

### squash 

standard here. chop the onion and seranno kinda. can't do it fine because the knife is shit keep those fingers.
add in there with the butter or ghee or whatever is on hand for slick medium.
half inch cubes for the squash. add that
i don't add salt too quickly because it draws the water out fast and you end up with your vegies more steamed than... i dunno the word. this is big for cabbage as well (i did this same recipe basically with cabbage instead of squash). 
so at your disgression add salt and pepper and oregano. few more stirs. then stop.


eat this with rice and tortillas. add whatever other condiments you can find in the goodwill annex that make sense.
