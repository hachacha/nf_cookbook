i basically followed this
https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/easy-kimchi
but didn't use the squid and used some other ingredients that i think went very nicely
and a mouse got in to my rice flour so i attempted to make my own rice flour by throwin rice in the food processer but that just made it dance around a bunch and didn't actually chop it up
so my ass used a mortar and pestel and manually got it done.

had just gotten my garden beds set up which meant pulling out all the dandelions. i kept all the greens and put them in here.

left for buffalo and then came back a week later and it was great
been just having it with a fried egg on top and some of those japanese rice crunchy things.


## ingredients

napa cabbage
rice flour
bunch of peppers
fish sauce
celery
garlic
white onion
SALT


## method

do the thing that maangchi says up top.
i put it in a big plastic thing in the fridge and then thought it needed more salt a day later so i hit it with more and put it in jars a few days later.
i did not finely chop the onion or the celery and left them big. i am happy with that decision. the dandelion greens 
i don't think you can have too much salt
and i thought it was going to be too hot but it's not 
so overdoing it is fine.
